My write-up for NCL Fall 2025 CTF

I competed with six other SANS classmates in the NCL Fall 2025 Team Game, placing 29th out of 4214 teams nationwide, ranking within the top 0.69% of all competitors. The CTF ran from Friday, November 7th through Sunday, November 9th.

Throughout the event, I gained hands-on experience across several cybersecurity domains, including log analysis, network scanning and reconnaissance, network traffic analysis, password cracking, and more. I was able to apply many of the techniques I learned from SEC401 (GSEC) and SEC504 (GCIH).

Some key techniques and areas I focused on during this CTF were: 

Reverse Engineering - I dove deep into binary analysis using Ghidra, dissecting compiled programs to understand their functionality, identify vulnerabilities, and uncover hidden flags embedded within the code.

Network Traffic Analysis - I leveraged Wireshark and tcpdump to analyze network packets, identifying malicious traffic patterns, extracting transmitted data, and reconstructing communication sessions to solve forensics challenges.

Web Application Exploitation - I performed comprehensive web enumeration and exploitation using techniques like XSS, command injection, and SQL injection. Tools such as Burp Suite and SQLmap were instrumental in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities across various web-based challenges.

Custom Script Development - I developed custom Python scripts to automate decoding and decryption tasks, allowing me to efficiently process encoded data and solve cryptography-related challenges that would have been time-consuming to do manually.

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) - I sharpened my reconnaissance skills by gathering publicly available information, correlating data across multiple sources, and piecing together digital footprints to uncover hidden clues and solve intelligence-gathering challenges.
