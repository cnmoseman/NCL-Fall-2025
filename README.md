# NCL-Fall-2025
My write up for NCL Fall 2025 CTF

I competed with six other SANS classmates in the NCL Fall 2025 Team Game, placing Xrd out of X teams nationwide, ranking within the top X% of all competitors. The CTF ran from Friday, November 7th through Sundday, November 9th.

Throughout the event, I gained hands-on experience across several cybersecurity domains, including log analysis, network scanning and reconnaissance, network traffic analysis, password cracking, and more. I was able to apply many of the techniques I learned from SEC401 (GSEC) and SEC504 (GCIH).
